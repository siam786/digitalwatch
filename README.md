### Description

1. The code begins with the standard HTML5 document structure, including the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.

2. Within the `<head>` section, the code includes various meta tags, such as character encoding and viewport settings, as well as a title tag for the web page.

3. The code also includes a `<link>` tag to reference an external CSS file named "style.css", which is used to add custom styles to the clock elements.

4. Inside the `<body>` section, there is a `<div>` element with the class "wrapper" that acts as a container for the clock display.

5. Within the wrapper, there is another `<div>` element with the class "display". This element serves as the container for the actual clock time display.

6. Inside the "display" div, there is a `<div>` element with the ID "time". This element will be used to display the formatted time.

7. At the end of the `<body>` section, there is a `<script>` tag that references an external JavaScript file named "main.js". This file contains the JavaScript code responsible for updating and displaying the clock time.

8. Moving to the JavaScript code, there is a function named `updateClock()`. This function is responsible for updating the clock display.

9. Inside the `updateClock()` function, the code uses the `document.querySelector()` method to select the HTML element with the ID "time" [1][2]. This element will be used to display the time.

10. The function then creates a new `Date` object to get the current time [3]. It extracts the hours, minutes, and seconds from the `Date` object using appropriate methods.

11. Next, the code checks if the hours value is greater than 12. If true, it sets the `day_night` variable to "PM" and subtracts 12 from the hours to convert them to the 12-hour format.

12. The code adds leading zeros to the minutes and seconds if their values are less than 10 [3].

13. Finally, the formatted time is assigned to the `textContent` property of the selected "time" element to update the displayed time.

14. The `updateClock()` function is initially called once to initialize the clock with the current time.

15. The `setInterval()` function is used to call the `updateClock()` function every second (1000 milliseconds) to continuously update the displayed time.

In summary, the provided code sets up the HTML structure for a digital clock and includes JavaScript code that retrieves the current time, formats it into hours, minutes, and seconds, and updates the content of the HTML element with the ID "time" to display the time in a 12-hour format with AM/PM indication. The clock is initially displayed upon page load and is continuously updated every second.
